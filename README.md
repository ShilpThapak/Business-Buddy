CS50 Web – Capstone Project: Business Buddy
===========================================

**Business Buddy** is CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software,
which helps the sales team of a company to get in touch with potential
customers.

Imagine you are a web-development service-provider who has a company
named 'TNL IT Solutions'. To get projects, you have created a website.
This website has a form, which customers can fill-up if they want any
kind of services from you.

But you don't know how to save these contacts and how to transfer these
contacts to the appropriate employees of your company.

This is where Business Buddy comes in.

If you connect your form (or website) with Business Buddy, all the
contact info filled in the form will be transferred to a database, which
will be available to your sales manager.

Sales team can then nurture these people and convert them into
customers.

How sales team can nurture the leads through Business Buddy?
------------------------------------------------------------

Sales associates get a dashboard where they will get all the info about
the leads. This helps them in knowing more about the customers. They can
also add more information about the customers with the help of sales
buddy, so they won't forget what the services the customer was
interested in.

To take timely follow-up associates can also add tasks in Business
Buddy. This feature will help them get back to the customers at the best
time possible.

Sales managers can also easily find out what's the status of all the
leads with the help of Sales Buddy. This will make their job easier as
well.

Why I believe my project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, mentioned above.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My project is distinct because it is neither a social media website nor
an e-commerce website.

Moreover, Business Buddy is a complex web application because it
requires complex Django models to create databases. And uses JavaScript
to create complex animations like a pop-up tasks option and manipulating
databases without reloading the page.

What's contained in each file you created.
------------------------------------------

My project contains a front-end for customers and a back-end for
employees.

I have created files like **index.html, index.css and index.js** for the
front-end, which is a single page company website.

I created files like **business-index.html** for the back-end of the
website and the home page of Business Buddy. The layout of this file is
stored in **business-layout.html** and **business-layout.css** files.

Apart from this **login.html** and **register.html** files contain a
small form to login and register respectively. Here you can register
yourself as a sales associate or a sales manager.

Employees can use the navigation bar at the top to go to "Sales Buddy".
I have created **sales.html** and **sales.css** files to create the
"Sales Buddy" page. This page shows a list of all the contacts/leads if
you have the access.

Finally, I have **created leadpage.html, leadpage.css** and
**leadpage.js** files to show the details of the lead and to add tasks &
activities associated with the lead.

How to run your application.
----------------------------

To run the application, just download the code from GitHub and use
command "python manage.py runserver".

The application will be available on <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>

To go to Business Buddy you have to go to the URL:
<http://127.0.0.1:8000/business-buddy>.

Any other additional information the staff should know about your project.

No.
